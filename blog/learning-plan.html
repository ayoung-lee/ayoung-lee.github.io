      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          <strong>What is the long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
          I want to be able to know how to do UI, coding, and database as a full-stact developer.<br>
          After that, I would also want to learn how the deployment cycle works as a DevOps.<br>
          Though my goal is not yet to aim for one particular role in the field,<br>
          but I want to grow into someone who is capable and independent and can manage the small business by oneself.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A description of your strength and limitations concerning learning.</strong>
          The strength I have is the ability to learn from mistakes.<br>
          When I make mistakes, I focus on how to resolve the issue and what step needs to be taken immediately.<br>
          Then, I would take time to reflect on what could have been done to prevent the mistakes and go over in my head what I would do if there will be a similar situation in the future.<br>
          I make several time blocks a day for studying and try to stick to the timetable as I can.<br>
          The cons of this would be that I only get to study when I think have enough time to do so.<br>
          But when coding, I quickly realised that frequent studying is more powerful.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What skills(non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong>
          As an introverted person, I tend to do more listening than talking.<br>
          I think it would be great if these can balance out while studying at Dev Academy.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</strong>
          <u>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</u><br>
          Make a priority and plan out each day according to my daily priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</strong>
          Firstly, I will look for the previous chats on discord if anyone has encountered the same problem or issue I want to seek help for.<br>
          Then, I will put my question up on the relevant channel eg tech-question, core questions etc.<br>\
          If still not solved, I would ask my facilitator John or anyone during the normal office hour. I guess 8-5 pm Mon-Fri(?).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</strong>
          If there are any changes or news regards to the academic calendar or learning modules etc.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</strong>
          I have church commitments every Thurs night from 7.30-9.30 pm and church service from 1.30-5.00 pm on Sun every week.<br>
          Therefore, Thursday night and Sunday afternoon will be blocked out from studying and chatting.<br>
          Daily household commitment. Approx 3 hours per day to look after my dog and household chores.<br>

    <h1>Learning Plan Reflection</h1>

          I revisited my career goals during the final group project checkout with the peers. I had more specific goals compared to the goals I had above. I very much enjoyed working in front end during the personal full stack project and final group project. This experience has allowed me to deepen my understanding and interest towards front end development.
        </li>
        <li>
          My short term goal is going through some official documents of React and Redux to practice more with these tools and make personal projects with them.
          The long term goal would be to find a suitable job that will allow me to utilise my front end skills to be websites.
        </li>
        <li>
          In terms of my human skills goals, I tried to speak up my voice when discussing ideas in group project. In the first group project, I barely spoke but listened to my group members discussing and talking about the directions and ideas. It was hard because I thought I was not entirely sure what I needed to do as a group member. I kept trying to talk more and more afterwards. By the time when I got to the final group projects, I was voted for my project ideas and became a product owner of the project. I was very comfortable even though I needed to talk a lot more than I usually do. I and really glad that it was my final project and I was able to takeaway so many valuable things from this project.

          From week 6 onwards, my best priority has been coding/studying. Therefore my daily routine was similar each day. Often there were time that I had to prioritise someting else. If I had some situdations like that, I tried not to stress myself out for not sticking to my priority list until the end. I will get back on track to finish the daily commitments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Asking questions in timely manner was probably the hardest thing for me. Most of the times, I would spend too much time to formulate my questions becuase a lot of time I didn't know what or how to ask about anything. It sometime resulted me not asking any questions. Though I realised that I tend to ask questions a lot more better when I am working with pairs or in groups. For this reason, I really enjoyed working with people on issues. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Overall, there are some things that I was able to develop from my initial plan but there are also things that totally did not look at it after foundation course. Now that the bootcamp is finished and I need an up to date study planning for my new routines and study. I am looking forward to update more of my planning here.
