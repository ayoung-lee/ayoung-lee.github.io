      <h1>Technical Blog - Problem Solving</h1>
        <p>
          On this page, I am going to be writing about some experiences where I had to deal with problem solving during the foundation course.
          <br>
          From my own experience, 10/10 I faced the problem everytime I am on a task. When stuck, it is easy to be passive and feel confused and frustrated. I learnt that the more I am in the state of these negative feelings the more I avoid solving it. Usually the reason I leave the issue unsolved is because I don't put effort in problem solving and captive in the negative feelings. 
          <br>
          The time when I was stuck on a simple problem is when I was working on the carnival challenge. I added the id name in img tag in HTML file. Then I call the id to getElementById('here') to be able to store whatever I needed to. I accidently typeed in '-' in the id and the computer didn't recognise the name. Therefore when I tried to get that id in JS file, the error message show up and saying that it was 'null'. I checked the JS file for a while but could not find the reason why. I tool a short break, and tried to think what the error message means and where is the actual problem is. Then I was able to find it was actually HTML file that was causing the problem not the JS file.
          <br>
          Reading the error message and critical thinking were helpful to solve the problem even though it took a while to fix it.  I think I am trying to read the error message more after then. The console.logging is a very good way to check the code unit. I recently started using this method and find this very useful. I google a lot but I don't think I am benefitting from this method than asking peers or coaches. There is always so many diferent answers and I cannot tell which one is right. The only way for me is to try everything but I find it very time consuming at this stage.
