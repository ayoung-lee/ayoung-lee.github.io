      <h1>Foundations Reflections</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>What are the three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</strong><br>
          1. I am more of a listener than a reader when it comes to take informations.
          During the foundation course, it has mosstly been strongly focused on self-supervised, self-learning environment. Therefore, it involved a lot of reading articles from researching. Then I reaslised that I was not taking much information as I was listenig someone teaching. Sometimes I had to go ever a few times to understand fully what the articles says.
          2. My biggest limitation in getting the code running is sometimes miss typing the codes. When I found errors it was over 90% caused by typos so far. Needed more typing practice.
          3. I am an introvert who prefers to work with people than alone (not everytime though). The hardest part of all was that I didn't have instant feedback from someone and it was often stressful that I spent too much time realising or fixing the problem myself when it was a simple typing mistakes which someone might have already spotted if working together.

          <strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</strong>
          Value - can indicates where my learning goal lies. 
          Empathy - is able to share feelings with others and also understanding other feelings. The coding is work bettween many otehr people hence the emphathy would be very crucial skills.
          Self-Awareness - It enables us to know who we are, what we want and seek out other opinions. It is a good trait for people in leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong>
          The quantity of work in core and tech each is pretty similar. I thought learning would be more skewed to technical aspects but having this much core exercises lead me to think that constant self reflectio is one of they key skills when working in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong>
          It was setting my values and identity. It took longer than I expected. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</strong>
          I came to think that core learning part where I can review and think back what I've done, how I could've done differently etc is like a fuel that makes the car move. Without these self reflections we're most probably burn out really quickly and easily get stressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong>
          When I didn't realise the importance of the self-reflection, yes. But now I think it is a good practice  to start building a good habit. It's going to become more and more tough and hard as we progree into more senior roles/ To be able to stay mentally healthy we need to constantly look into our minds and look after them.
