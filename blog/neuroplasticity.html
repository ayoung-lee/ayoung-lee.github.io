        <h1>How Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset affects learning?</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Part 1. Neuroplasticity</strong>
            Neuroplasticity means the selective organising of connections between neurons in our brains. The neurons are the fundamental units of the brain and are responsible for receiving sensory input from the external world, sending motor commands to our muscles, and transforming and relaying electrical signals in every step in between. Neuroplasticity suggests that we can change and alter how our physical brain looks by simply repeatedly practising an activity or access to memory. It means that our brains are constantly changing depending on what activities we are practising and accessing. Therefore we are able to do our daily tasks with fewer efforts over a series of regular practice.
            <br>
            After learning about neuroplasticity, I can implement this exercise into my daily routine for Bootcamp such as studying for 8 hours from 8.30 am - 6.30 pm (including 2 hr lunch break) from Monday to Friday. I usually try not to think about work during the weekends, but for my brain to perform best on Mondays, I will do at least 15 mins coding on Saturday and Sunday. In order to improve my neuroplasticity, daily reflections such as writing my log day to day can be done for better brain retention.

            <strong>Part 2. Growth Mindset</strong>
            Not long Before I came to dev academy, I read the book 'Mindset' by Carol Dweck and found it interesting. Though I never finished it. From my understanding, the gist of the story is if you're a fixed mindset person, It will limit your ability and mostly get frightened by any failure you make along the way and it keeps you from going forward. However, the people with the growth mindset, use failure as a way to improve themselves and perceive others differently from those with a fixed mindset. When you are encountered with any problems or issues (which we must at any given moment) it helps you to see the problem not only as pain but as an antidote

            <strong>How does it shape or influence my learning plan?</strong>
            In a time management wise, I adapted the pomodoro techniques which states that save so much time and still maximise the efficiency at the same time. The each time block equals to 25mins and after each time block, there is a 5 min break. At the end of every 4 time blocks (after 2hrs) there is a 30 min break.
