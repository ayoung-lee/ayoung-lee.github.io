      <br>
      <p>In CSS, there are important fundamentals called margin, border, and padding.<br>In this blog article, I have writen my findings of what they are and how they are used in CSS.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The <strong>margin</strong> is the space around the element's border.<br>It can make the gap between the other elements either big or small.
      <br>The <strong>padding</strong> is the space around the contents.<br>It controls the internal space of an element while the margin controls the outside of an element.
      <br>The <strong>border</strong> is inbetween the margin and padding.</p>
      <br>
      <figcaption>
      <img class="img1" src="screenshot1.png" alt="">
      <figcaption>Fig.1.</figcaption>
      </figcaption>
      <br>
      <p>In the figure 1, it shows margin, padding, and border with a certain number in pixel.<br>We will break down
      each with the code and compare the differences when the different values are given.</p>
      <br>
      <figcaption>
      <img class="imgcode" src="imgcode.png">
      <figcation>Fig.2.</figcation>
      </figcaption>
      <br>
      <p>The above picture (Fig2) is the respective code of figure 1.<br>The '.main' is the style of the main class. The heading in the background is effected by this style.
      <br>Secondly, the '.box' means for class named box. In the CSS we can assign different value towards top, left, bottom, and right margins. <br>The units in CSS is px, em, or %. In the current picutre, margin-left is 500px. It means the gap betweeb the box and the other element is 500px.
      <br>In this case, the other element is the left end of the page. If there was an other element next to the box and is also set as margin-right:500px,
      <br>the total gap between the elements will be 1000px.
      <br>
      <br>The width and height of the elements is simply the size of the object or elements.
      <br>The text-align: center mean to make the text go in the center of the relative element.
      <br>The padding control the gap between the content and the border. Hence, if the padding increases, the gap between them increases and vice versa.</p>
      </p>
      <br>
      <figcaption>
      <img class="img1" src="screenshot2.png" alt="">
      <figcaption>Fig.3.</figcaption>
      </figcaption>
      <br>
      <p>What happens if I change the values of padding, border, and margin?
        <br>
        In the figure 3, it shows still shows the box we reffered eariler but looks different.<br>
        It is because the margin, padding, and border are different to the about figure. Let's look into it.
      </p>
      <br>
      <figcaption>
      <img class="imgcode" src="screenshot3.png">
      <figcaption>Fig.4.</figcaption>
      </figcaption>
      <br>
      <p>
        I've cut down the numbers in halves so the changes can be easily noticed.<br>
      Now, the box is closer to the end of the screen compared to the original picture.<br>
      The pink area which is the border is now narrower as the value reduced from 50px to 25px.<br>
      The padding is now 25px and is also halved. Then contents and the pink area (border) is closer than the first image.
