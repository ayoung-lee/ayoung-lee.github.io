      <h1>Javascript Fundamental</h1>
        <h2>What is Javascript and its relationship to HTML and CSS?</h2>
          <p>
            A carpenter needs a saw to make a table, a developer needs a few programmes to make softwares.
            Javascript, HTML and CSS together make a good team to make a software.
            Javascript is a trained carpenter who can choose what material to use, how to use the saw to cut the panels, and decides which part goes where to be assembled as a table. 
            The HTML is each part of the table yet to be assembled. The pieces of legs or table top themselves are a visible sturcture of the table but html itself does not know how to assemble them together.
            Lastly, CSS is responsible for the outer looks of the table such as whether the tbales is lacquerd or stained in colours. Likewise, the CSS in software decorate what the users can see.

        <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
          <p>
            To explain the control flow and loops in my everyday life, I can assimilate my daily dog walking activity to what the control flow and loops are.
            Say my daily route is home -> reserve -> bush walk -> reserve -> library ->  home. It is the control flow which I(walker) executes in every walk. Without the loops, each walk will take exactly the same time. In the case, the loops can described as a condition each time Haru (dog, 1 year old) finishes what he is allowed to do (smelling, going to the bathroom etc) he will have to come and sit in front of me to inform that he is ready to move on. Otherwise, I(walker) cannot proceed to the next stop and have to wait until Haru(dog, 1year old) is focused and show me some sign that he is happy to go forward.
          </p>
        <h2>What is DOM</h2>
          <p>
            The DOM is abbreciated for Document Object Model. The DOM enables us to interact with the objects in HTML documents. Using the Javascript, we can add, manipulate, remove or change the contents or styling of the documents. In order to do this, we need a specific ids or classes so the computer will know which part we wants to change. 
          </p>
        <h2>How to access data from arrays and objects?</h2>
          <p>
            We can access to the nested data in objects or arrays by applying dot or bracket notations respectively.
          </p>
        <h2>Functions</h2>
          <p>
            Functions in Javascript are very essential building blocks. According to mdc web docs, it is described as a procedure. The meaning of which is (n) 1. a series of actions conducted in a certain order or manner. 2. a surgical operation.
            For example, if you have a robot that runs your errands to buy a packet of milk from countdown, you will have to specifically tell the robot how to get there, what to buy, the quanity of milk you want to buy etc. You can just type in the lines of code to make sure the robot understands what you want. What happens if you want to get more milk? you cannot write down the codes each time you want to change something because that would be a waste of time. Instead, you can use function. First, you would name the function called 'buyMilk' and include all your codes in the function. Therefore, instead of typing all the lines of code, you can simply call this function buyMilk(). </p>
