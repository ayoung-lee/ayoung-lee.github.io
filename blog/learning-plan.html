      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
      <p><strong>What is the long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
      My long term goal is to become a competent developer.<br>
      I want to be able to know how to do UI, coding, and database as a full-stact developer.<br>
      After that, I would also want to learn how the deployment cycle works as a DevOps.<br>
      Though my goal is not yet to aim for one particular role in the field,<br>
      but I want to grow into someone who is capable and independent and can manage the small business by oneself.<br>
      <strong>A description of your strength and limitations concerning learning.</strong>
      The strength I have is the ability to learn from mistakes.<br>
      When I make mistakes, I focus on how to resolve the issue and what step needs to be taken immediately.<br>
      Then, I would take time to reflect on what could have been done to prevent the mistakes and go over in my head what I would do if there will be a similar situation in the future.<br>
      I make several time blocks a day for studying and try to stick to the timetable as I can.<br>
      The cons of this would be that I only get to study when I think have enough time to do so.<br>
      But when coding, I quickly realised that frequent studying is more powerful.<br>
      <strong>What skills(non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong>
      As an introverted person, I tend to do more listening than talking.<br>
      I think it would be great if these can balance out while studying at Dev Academy.<br>
      <strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</strong>
      <u>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</u><br>
      Make sure I am up to date with my work to discuss with my peers in the homegroup meeting.<br>
      <u>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.</u><br>
      I would visualise the things I need to finish and try to get it done with asap.<br>
      eg. writing the things down on post-it paper and stick it on the wall in sequential order. 
      Then, take off the ones that have been done.
      <strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</strong>
      Firstly, I will look for the previous chats on discord if anyone has encountered the same problem or issue I want to seek help for.<br>
      Then, I will put my question up on the relevant channel eg tech-question, core questions etc.<br>\
      If still not solved, I would ask my facilitator John or anyone during the normal office hour. I guess 8-5 pm Mon-Fri(?).<br>
      <strong>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</strong>
      If there are any changes or news regards to the academic calendar or learning modules etc.<br>
      <strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</strong>
      I have church commitments every Thurs night from 7.30-9.30 pm and church service from 1.30-5.00 pm on Sun every week.<br>
      Therefore, Thursday night and Sunday afternoon will be blocked out from studying and chatting.<br>
      Daily household commitment. Approx 3 hours per day to look after my dog and household chores.<br>
