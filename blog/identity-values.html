        <h1>Identity, Values, and Strength</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</strong><br>
          <u>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.<br>
            Discuss how you weighed up the values involoved in that devision,<br>
            the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</u>
          <br>
          My core personal values are authenticity and honesty.<br>
          The most recent ethical decision I made is when we were in the red lights setting in Auckland.<br>
          The  limitations have been put in on the gatherings and events of participants to 100 people max in one building.<br>
          The event our team was organising was expecting more than 100 people to attend.<br>
          Therefore, we arranged two seperate buildings as spaces for events to happen.<br>
          The problem was after the initial event, there were designed to be group meetings.<br>
          Our team, who was responsible for welcoming and organising people in each building, was not able to come up with a solution<br>
          where we does not have people from the different builidng meet each other and still can have a group meetings.<br>
          The dilema was to either allow them to mix and mingle which is against the guidline the govt proposed.<br>
          The other thing was to cancel all the meetings.<br>
          We made a decision to cancel the group meetings and completely isoloate the two groups from each other to prevent further spreading the virus in the community.<br>
          But we didn’t ban the meeting as long as it follows the govt rules, so if there were people who wanted to catch up they could still meet up afterwards.<br>
          Though it was a collective decision making, I agreed to the decision because it is safer for everyone.<br>
          <u>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</u>
          <br>
          I think my values have formed from my parents. They have always taught me to be kind, honest and authentic when treating people.
          <br>
          <strong>2. Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</strong><br>
          <u>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</u><br>
          My strengths I think I have in academic wise is learning from mistakes. Thinking about my academic values brings me back memories in university.<br>
          I was preparing and studying towards my graduation projects in design school in thrid year. We went through weekly crits which I had to present my work in progress and gain feedbacks from peers and lecturers.<br>
          At first I was not comfortable presenting my unfinished work because I didn’t think I was ready to show them my mistakes in work in progress. I only wanted to showed them what I have done best and good side of the projects.<br>
          But as soon as I repeated doing the presentation as a weekly rituals, I began to realise and learn to focus on what could have been done differently to improve my work and not how other people will conceive my work.<br>
          Then I learned that discussing and sharing your mistakes with others really help to analyse the problem easier and come up with better solution quicker. So for me, sharing and discussing with others have been the key to success at learning from mistakes.
          <br>
          <u>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.<br>
          Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</u><br>
          When I was wokring as an interior designer, the work involoved a lot of communication with clients, labours who work at factory, and installers.<br>
          We had different working hours, offices, roles, and responsibility. Therfore the mistakes or miscommunication oftern arise and resulted in complaints from the clients.<br>
          Which made the frequent tensions between us. I have requested to my boss that we needed a good system to prevent further frictions between people.<br>
          So he appointed the production manager to look after the whole process rather than each of us to look after bit by bit.
